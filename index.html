    <h1>Git and GitHub Explanation</h1>
    <p><strong>Git:</strong> Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during
        software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently by managing
        revisions and facilitating code merging.</p>
    <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides hosting for Git
        repositories and additional features such as collaboration tools, issue tracking, and project management. It
        allows developers to store their Git repositories remotely and provides a centralized location for collaboration
        and code sharing.</p>
    <p>Git and GitHub are essential tools in modern software development workflows, enabling teams to work together
        effectively, track changes, and manage projects efficiently.</p>
